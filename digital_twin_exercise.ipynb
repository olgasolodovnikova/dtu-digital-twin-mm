    "- explain the difference between a digital model, a digital shadow, and a digital twin.​\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise consists of two sets of multiple-choice questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1** considers general definitions and concepts of digital twins that reinforce the following learning objectives from the micromodule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2** contains a simulated interaction with a digital twin. You will need to execute and interact with Python scripts, which are available at the github repository (https://github.com/olgasolodovnikova/dtu-digital-twin-mm.git). You can watch an introductory video covering the installation as well as how you can interact with the code. The files can be evaluated using the included `digital_twin_exercise.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, or executed in your preferred Python IDE. \n"
